Abstract ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modeling human brain activity is still an open problem for science.  The effectiveactivity induces a problem where the activation of certain brain regions cannot be ana-lyzed as an isolated entity but may depend on the flow of information from other regions.Hypothesizing that this flow of information that triggers brain activity has a –causalnature– and may be confined to a well defined –topological space–, allows us to studythis phenomenon in terms ofcomputational geometry. This proposal aims to develop andvalidate the coupling of a causal structure on a hyper-cylindrical manifold that admitsthe existence of causal curves between projected brain events.An algorithm is proposed that makes use of information extracted from FunctionalNear-Infrared Spectroscopy and projected onto a Lorentz manifold to find –topologicalcausal curves– that lead to an interpretation of causal influence between regions of brainactivity.
