Abstract ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modeling human brain activity is still an open problem for science.  The effective activity induces a problem where the activation of certain brain regions cannot be analyzed as an isolated entity but may depend on the flow of information from other regions. Hypothesizing that this flow of information that triggers brain activity has a – causal nature – and may be confined to a well defined – topological space –, allows us to study this phenomenon in terms of computational geometry. This proposal aims to develop and validate the coupling of a causal structure on a hyper-cylindrical manifold that admits the existence of causal curves between projected brain events. An algorithm is proposed that makes use of information extracted from Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy and projected onto a Lorentz manifold to find –topological causal curves– that lead to an interpretation of causal influence between regions of brainactivity.
